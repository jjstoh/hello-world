About myself:
I am currently 19, and have recently acquired .a new laptop with the power to run my dreams. Well, an i7-9750H and 16GB of RAM to run my games and my programs. And my school work.
I am a second year university Physics MSci student at UCL in the laboratory stream, and this might come in handy. Who knows?
Maybe in time I will look back at this moment as a cool moment on my journey to learning about programming. Lets hope so.
